# Object Detection Demo: The Facemask Identifier in Browser

This project demonstrates the [YOLO object detection](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo) into an interactive [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) app.

The objective behind this project is to identify facemasks from any image. It could possibly used as whether someone is wearing a facemask in the Post-Covid World

The complete demo is [implemented in pure python](https://github.com/iamanuragmalakar/facemask_demo/new/master/app.py).

We intend to add to this demo and make it a tutorial for anyone willing to get started with deploying their models into real world use cases.
